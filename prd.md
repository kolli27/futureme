# FutureSync - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

FutureSync is an AI-powered life transformation platform that helps users align daily habits with long-term identity goals through time budgeting and smart recommendations. The app combines the time allocation methodology of YNAB with the habit science of Atomic Habits, powered by AI insights that create a premium, subscription-worthy experience.

**Target Market**: Ambitious professionals and personal development enthusiasts aged 25-45
**Business Model**: Freemium with $29.99/year premium subscription
**Revenue Goal**: $300M ARR at 10M users + enterprise contracts

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: AI Integration Required

**Current Status**: The app has beautiful UI and functional data flows, but AI features are currently mock data/static content. For the app to be truly functional and deliver on its "AI-powered" value proposition, real AI integration is essential.

**Priority AI Components**:
1. **Daily Actions Generation** - Currently uses static templates, needs real AI analysis of vision descriptions
2. **Insights & Recommendations** - Currently hardcoded text, needs real behavior pattern analysis  
3. **Vision Processing** - Currently just storage, needs NLP understanding and goal extraction
4. **Smart Time Optimization** - Needs AI-suggested time allocations based on complexity and user patterns

**Without real AI integration, the app is essentially a beautifully designed habit tracker, not the transformative AI platform described in this PRD.**

## Product Vision

"Become the platform where ambitious people transform their lives through AI-powered daily habits that align with their future identity."

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Time as Currency**: Treat time like money - allocate every minute to your goals
2. **Multiple Identity Goals**: Support Health, Career, Relationships, Personal Growth simultaneously
3. **AI-Powered Growth**: Smart recommendations that evolve with user progress
4. **Radical Simplicity**: Complex AI planning hidden behind simple daily actions
5. **Social Validation**: Victory sharing creates viral growth and motivation
